// [7GUIs] The task is to build a frame containing the following elements:
// [7GUIs] a textfield Tprefix, a pair of textfields Tname and Tsurname, a listbox L,
// [7GUIs] buttons BC, BU and BD and the three labels as seen in the screenshot.
// [7GUIs] L presents a view of the data in the database that consists of a list of names.
// [7GUIs] At most one entry can be selected in L at a time.
// [7GUIs] By entering a string into Tprefix the user can filter the names whose surname start with the entered prefix
// [7GUIs] —this should happen immediately without having to submit the prefix with enter.
// [7GUIs] Clicking BC will append the resulting name from concatenating the strings in Tname and Tsurname to L.
// [7GUIs] BU and BD are enabled if an entry in L is selected.
// [7GUIs] In contrast to BC, BU will not append the resulting name but instead replace the selected entry with the new name.
// [7GUIs] BD will remove the selected entry.

// [7GUIs] The layout is to be done like suggested in the screenshot. In particular, L must occupy all the remaining space.

// [7GUIs] CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) represents a typical graphical business application.
// [7GUIs] The primary challenge is the separation of domain and presentation logic in the source code
// [7GUIs] that is more or less forced on the implementer due to the ability to filter the view by a prefix.
// [7GUIs] Traditionally, some form of MVC pattern is used to achieve the separation of domain and presentation logic.
// [7GUIs] Also, the approach to managing the mutation of the list of names is tested.

// [7GUIs] A good solution will have a good separation between the domain and presentation logic without much overhead
// [7GUIs] (e.g. in the form of toolkit specific concepts or language/paradigm concepts),
// [7GUIs] a mutation management that is fast but not error-prone
// [7GUIs] and a natural representation of the layout (layout builders are allowed, of course, but would increase the overhead).

// [7GUIs] CRUD is directly inspired by the crud example in the blog post FRP - Three principles for GUI elements with bidirectional data flow.
