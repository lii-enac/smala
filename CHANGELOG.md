## [1.10.0] - 2020-05-07
### compliant with djnn-cpp [1.11.0]
    - please see CHANGELOG.md of djnn-cpp for more in-depth details changes

### NEW
    - NEW MAJOR REFACTORING - see the HowTo below
        - Path as p.1 must be written p.[1]
        - It is now possible to write: p.[<expr>] as 
            ex.: p.[i+1] = 10
        - toString is a function that takes a process as argument and returns a literal string
            ex.: string s = toString (p)
        - String concatenation can be done with the + operator but the first term must be explicitly a string
            ex.: "foo" + p + "bar" => t
            ex.: toString(p) + "bar" => t
        - the comparison between processes requires an explicit cast
            ex.: &p1 == &p2
        - Addchild has been remove and replace by : <<
            ex.: a << b
            ex.: a << myfunc () // such as clone, or loadFromXML ...
        - the use of "$" (get_value() of a int/bool/double property ) has changed. 
            $(expression) is now directly written $expression.
            ex.: $(foo.bar) ==> $foo.bar
          The sign is not needed when it is obvious : 
            ex.: sqrt(foo.angle)
          But it is needed when you call constructors :
            ex: My_rectangle rect ($foo.x, $foo.y, 100, 100)
        - Added anonymous assignmentSequence : a -> { b =: c }
        - (for now) the use a the "dump" function has changed. cannot specify the dump level 
            ex.: dump foo
        - You can ask for the source of a native action using keyword : _src_
            ex.: rect.press -> (root) {
                foo = _src_
            }
        - Improved EOL management : should use "\" sign if a instruction is write on several lines.
        - Added support of "0x" prefix for int (hexa)
        - (test) added new keyword : _keep_ to keep the name of a c++ variable

    - NEW libsmala.dylib/so : a lib with widgets, behavior and others shared code.
        - just start need to be fill. for now : simpleDrag, button
    - NEW added install rule and pkg-config support for libsmala in Makefile
    - NEW Drag'n Drop (dnd) cookbook recipe 
    - NEW dynamic_rectangle cookbook recipe
    - NEW midi cookbook recipe

          The sign is not needed when it is obvious : 
            ex.: sqrt(foo.angle)
          But it is needed when you call constructors :
            ex: My_rectangle rect ($foo.x, $foo.y, 100, 100)
    - Renamed cookbook/network ==> cookbook/comms
    - Improved nativeaction cookbook recipe
    - Improved editor_mode for sublime_text: toString, _src_
