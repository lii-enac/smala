Smala is a dedicated language for programming interactive software.

It is the result of the work from the Interactive Informatics team at ENAC http://lii.recherche.enac.fr 

This software provides a compiler that translates a Smala program into a C++ one. To compile the executable, you need to install the djnn-cpp library: https://github.com/lii-enac/djnn-cpp
